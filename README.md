# curb-alert
Curb-Alert is a real-time monitoring tool designed to scan social media posts and notify users when content is geographically relevant to them. The content comes from accounts that post pictures of abandoned furniture on the streets of NYC. This project aims to help New Yorkers furnish their home for free.
