# curb-alert
Curb-Alert is a real-time monitoring tool designed to scan social media for posts of abandoned NYC treasures and notify users when something near-by is found. The posts come from accounts that upload pictures of abandoned furniture on the streets of NYC. This project aims to help New Yorkers furnish their home for free.
